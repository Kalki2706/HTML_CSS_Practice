Number of values determines number of columns & the value itself determines the width of the column

Whenever we have more elements than the columns the elements wrap around & create new rows

1fr means free space it means if you set 1 fr it will take that rows all remaining space.

if you set value to 2fr it will take twice the space of 1fr & it's relatively responsive
